## Key Features

- **Dynamic Stock Management**: Stations consume goods based on activity level, station type, and good-specific consumption rates, leading to more realistic trade and profit generation.
- **Equipment Dock Upgrade**: Increases the amount and variety of subsystems, turrets, and fighters available in equipment docks, balancing rarity probabilities.

- **Factory Overview Tab**: Track expenses, revenues, and profits of factories via a new tab in the player window. Hourly profit estimates update after five minutes of playtime.
- **ReSeed - Quality Randomizer**: Turret and upgrade seeds are randomized at the sector level, increasing galaxy-wide loot diversity with over 1,000,000 unique seeds.
- **Subsystem Removal**: Permanently installed subsystems can now be removed at various stations such as Repair Dock, Scrapyard, Shipyard, Military Outpost, and Research Station, giving you flexibility in managing your ship systems.
- **Shop Restock Button**: A button allows you to restock shop inventories at will. (Use sparingly to avoid crashes!)
- **Scrapyard Timer Removal**: Eliminates the 1-hour scrapyard time limit, allowing for unlimited time purchases.
- **Ship Flight Recorder**: Provides detailed fleet information via a new player window tab.
- **Trash Manager**: Bulk sell unwanted items at merchants using a customizable UI.

- **Trade Heatmap Expansion**: Expands the trade heatmap to multiple quadrants based on subsystem quality.
- **Transponder Range Scaling**: Transporter subsystem range scales with the number of transporter blocks installed.
- **Universal Bulletin Board**: Centralized mission acquisition through the player UI for easier access.

- **Wreckage Tab in Strategy Mode**: Adds a tab in strategy view listing mass-sorted salvageable wrecks for easy targeting.

## Commands and Captain Enhancements

- **Persistent Captain Commands**: Captain commands persist when offline and are now fast-forwarded upon returning to the game, with ambushes triggered retroactively. Time progresses at a 2/3 rate, adding a risk/reward factor to the real-time management aspect.
- **Scout Command Improvements**: Real-time galaxy map updates during scouting missions, scaling mission duration based on equipment, providing hidden mass sector discoveries, and reworked Operation Exodus beacons are now discoverable by Explorer captains.
- **Trade Command Enhancements**: Trade missions scale with captain class and ship capabilities. Immediate deliveries and charity options are also available for reputation gains. Any captain can trade; however, non-merchants will be less efficient.
- **Refine Command Updates**: Refining checks for sector-based possibilities to reduce ambush chances and shorten mission duration. Assessment text reflects these bonuses when applicable.
- **Travel Command Refinement**: Speeds are automatically maximized when no ambushes are possible.
